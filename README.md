Website for Veil, a guild and gaming community

# Veil: GuildHub

>Currently a work in progress!

#### Why did I decide to do this?
- A lot of guild website builders are ugly, outdated, not responsive
- Difficult to communicate for bigger guilds
- One place for everything


#### What is this exactly?
- A hub for gaming communities containing guild information, announcements, events, blog posts, etc.


#### How did I build this?
- I built this with HTML5, CSS3, and Sass using the [Bulma](http://bulma.io) framework, along with JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and Axios for the front-end. I deployed my front-end with Surge. I used Node.js, Express.js, Knex.js, and PostgreSQL for the back-end. I deployed my back-end with Heroku.

#### What's next?
- Roles & permissions
- Event calendar
- Integrate with games and Discord
- Forum/message board

For now, a current working version is available [here](http://veil.surge.sh).
